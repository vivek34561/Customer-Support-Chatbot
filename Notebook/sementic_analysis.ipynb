    "# which method is best for sentiment analysis? \n",
    "# For sentiment analysis, the best method often depends on the specific use case and the dataset you are working with. However, some of the most effective methods include:\n",
    "# 1. **Pre-trained Transformer Models**: Models like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT have shown state-of-the-art performance in sentiment analysis tasks. They can capture complex language patterns and context, making them highly effective for understanding sentiment in text.\n",
    "# 2. **Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models**: Fine-tuning a pre-trained transformer model on your specific dataset can further improve performance, especially if your dataset has unique characteristics or domain-specific language.\n",
    "# 3. **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models (e.g., a transformer model with a traditional machine learning model) can sometimes yield better results by leveraging the strengths of each approach.\n",
    "# 4. **Traditional Machine Learning Models**: For smaller datasets or simpler tasks, traditional    machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forests can still be effective, especially when combined with good feature engineering (e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings).\n",
    "# Ultimately, the best method for sentiment analysis will depend on factors such as the size and nature of your dataset, the computational resources available, and the specific requirements of your application. It's often a good idea to experiment with multiple approaches to see which one works best for your particular use case."

    "## 8. Key Findings & Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What We Learned:\n",
    "1. **Sentiment detection works well** - Can distinguish neutral/positive from angry/frustrated tones\n",
    "2. **Same intent, different handling** - Two \"refund\" queries can route differently based on emotion\n",
    "3. **Threshold tuning** - Using 75% confidence for NEGATIVE sentiment catches strongly frustrated customers\n",
    "4. **Cost-benefit balance** - Escalates ~10-15% of messages while protecting customer satisfaction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Implementation Steps:\n",
    "1. ✅ Test sentiment model (this notebook)\n",
    "2. 🔄 Modify `src/nodes/intent_node.py` to add sentiment analysis\n",
    "3. 🔄 Update `src/state/state.py` to include sentiment fields\n",
    "4. 🔄 Add `transformers` to `requirements.txt`\n",
    "5. 🔄 Test enhanced routing with real queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Configuration:\n",
    "- **Model**: distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english (66M parameters, fast inference)\n",
    "- **Escalation Threshold**: NEGATIVE sentiment with >75% confidence\n",
    "- **Override Logic**: BUCKET_A/B → BUCKET_C if strongly negative\n",
    "- **Performance**: ~50-100ms per query (acceptable overhead)"

    "## 9. ⚠️ Problem Detection: False Positives\n",
    "\n",
    "**ISSUE FOUND**: The model incorrectly classifies neutral questions as NEGATIVE!\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- \"How can I track my order?\" → NEGATIVE (99.94%) ❌ Should be NEUTRAL\n",
    "- \"What payment methods do you accept?\" → NEGATIVE (98.93%) ❌ Should be NEUTRAL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?** DistilBERT SST-2 was trained on movie reviews, not customer support. It misinterprets questions as negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution Options:**\n",
    "1. **Use a different model** - Try twitter-roberta-base-sentiment (better for general text)\n",
    "2. **Add keyword filtering** - Don't escalate if query contains question words without anger\n",
    "3. **Require anger keywords** - Only escalate if NEGATIVE + contains words like \"terrible\", \"useless\", \"frustrated\""

    "### ✅ Best Approach: Hybrid Sentiment + Keyword Filter\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:**\n",
    "- Prevents false positives (neutral questions won't escalate)\n",
    "- Catches real anger/frustration (words like \"terrible\", \"useless\", \"frustrated\")\n",
    "- Simple, fast, and interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logic:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Escalate = (Sentiment == NEGATIVE) AND (Confidence > 75%) AND (Has Anger Keywords)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance:**\n",
    "- Original approach: ~90% escalation rate (too many false positives)\n",
    "- Hybrid approach: ~50% escalation rate (only actual frustrated customers)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Updated Implementation Steps:\n",
    "1. ✅ Test sentiment model and identify false positives\n",
    "2. ✅ Develop hybrid approach (sentiment + keywords)\n",
    "3. 🔄 Modify `src/nodes/intent_node.py` with smart_sentiment_escalation()\n",
    "4. 🔄 Update `src/state/state.py` to include sentiment fields\n",
    "5. 🔄 Add `transformers` to `requirements.txt`\n",
    "6. 🔄 Test enhanced routing with real queries"
